Each character is represented by a circle and the connecting lines (or springs) represent interaction. The character's size indicates the number of interactions they have over the entire play. Drag or zoom the graph (using the mouse scroll wheel) to get a better view.,"A force-directed layout is a technique used in network visualization to arrange nodes (or vertices) and edges (or links) in a graph in a visually appealing and meaningful way. The layout is based on simulating physical forces among the elements of the network.In a force-directed layout, nodes are typically represented as points in space, and edges as lines connecting those points. The layout algorithm then applies forces to these points to simulate attraction and repulsion between connected and unconnected nodes, respectively. By iteratively adjusting the positions of nodes based on these forces, the layout algorithm aims to reach an equilibrium where nodes are evenly distributed and edges have minimal crossing. The result is a visually appealing arrangement that often reveals patterns, clusters, and structures within the network.",5
